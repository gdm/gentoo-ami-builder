2. make sure AWS displays dmesg (limit speed tty)

(in progress - test with new cloud-init) hostname not persistent (installed by cloud-init)
related issue: https://bugs.launchpad.net/cloud-init/+bug/1246485
try  : /etc/hostname with cloud-init

/etc/conf.d/hostname:
hostname="# Set to the hostname of this machinegentoo"




(in progress - test with trust cpu code - new in 4.18 kernel)

gentoo seed for urandom
/var/lib/misc/random-seed
how to setup with cloud-init: http://blog.dustinkirkland.com/2012/10/seed-devurandom-through-metadata-ec2.html
also urandom should be configured to start after cloud-init-local


mount and umount /dev/shm/ inside chroot gentoo (prevent rebuilding python36, probably something else)
